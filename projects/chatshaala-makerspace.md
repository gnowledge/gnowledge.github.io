MakerSpace Chatshaalas are conversation-based mentoring sessions around making and tinkering projects. These are open to everyone(educators, students, researchers) to join in where one can share the journey of making including the learnings and challenges during the project. 

The interactions on MakerSpace chatShalaa webinar are recorded for research and training purposes. Some of the sessions are also live-streamed on youtube for wider outreach and released under creative commons license. The recorded discussions become an important resource for the wider community of educators, students and researchers. This also helps us draw insights about learning in the context of making which is still an under-researched domain. We earnestly seek consent for the members to contribute to the research endeavours and also help co-create Open Educational Resources for wider access.
