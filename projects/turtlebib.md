<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Twenty things to do with Computer is a short report by Papert and Cynthia from MIT AI Lab to show the alternatives ways computers can be used in education as compared to the traditional "problem solving" uses like calculating the sum of the square of first 10 odd numbers?. This has several examples that gradually introduces the reader to the LOGO language and also discusses its specific affordance. Right from making a robotic turtle, to doing differential geometry, music box, light show, poetry, puppets, etc the article is a fascinating read for educators, researchers and anyone interested in K12 education.
