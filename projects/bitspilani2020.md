# Image 3D

We have all seen images of strange and beautiful things that are possible to view under a microscope. Imagine if rather than being limited to 2 dimensions, we could interact with a 3D model in VR. It would add a different dimension (quite literally) to our experience.

This project aims at creating a tool that would enable the conversion of a set of images of the subject/specimen into a 3D model. This is done using a technique called Photogrammetry.

The project also consists of designing a movable stage for the microscope to take images of a specimen from different angles. Both the tool and the design will be incorporated together to produce 3D models of microscopic subjects, which could be viewed with any 3d software(or even a VR headset)

# TurtleBot

Turtlebot is a small robot which has a pen attached to its bottom. We give an equation as an input to this robot and it is able to draw the graph of that equation on the paper. Turtlebot is meant for children(or even adults!) to play with. Students can interact with an easy software, feed the equation and see the graph drawn on a real paper. It introduces them with simple coding,maths and understanding of electronic components.

The project aims to develop a turtlebot which is affordable, power efficient and open source. Open source so that everyone is able to modify and come with their own versions.

# STEMChat App

Light weight progressive responsive Web App to work with metastudio.org.

India being a huge country, network operators find it hard to upgrade their towers in all places thus certain regions are left out with poor internet speeds. But knowledge, being the most important resource in human life, needs to be shared and accessible to all. The current website provides STEM education to masses through public discussion. The data that the website consumes makes it slow in regions with poor internet connectivity.

The project aims to bring the goodness of the platform in a lighter package which makes the ideas and STEM practices available to all and therefore fulfils the aspiration of being inclusive and spreading STEM habits across India.

The project will build a lighter version of the current website which is progressive and responsive thus being device independent i.e. both mobile and desktop users can interact and enjoy the same user experience.

# ThinQ-Lib

ThinQ-Lib is a framework built over the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) network. It provides a way to enable storing files in a distrbuted file system along with encryption to ensure data privacy. It also uses a Graph-based data digest format - [GDF](https://github.com/Sreyas-108/GDF.git) to represent data internally.      
Currently, the framework offers the following features:
-  **Handshake:** Hnadshake refers to the process of two users sharing their unique id's on the network with each other, so that they can communicate with each other later. This is very similar to sharing phone numbers between users.       
- **Chatting:** Using the framework, users can directly share text messages with each other, without the involvement of any central server or authority. The messages that are transfered over the network are encrypted using asymmetric key cryptography, so that data privacy is maintained.      
- **File Sharing:** Users can also share files between each other using the framework. The important point to note here is that the file never actually leaves your system. Only the file of the hash is transmitted to other users, and whenever someone needs to access the file, they need to access it from your local machine. This is in-line with the aim of protecting user-data within the framework.       
- **Service Requests:** Service requests are pre-formatted text messages that are sent between users to perform specific tasks based on the requirements of the application developed using the framework. The difference between messages and requests is that requests need to be closed through a 3-way handshake mechanism to ensure that both parties have an equal say in the process.    
- **Prioritization of Requests:** Service requests can be prioritized based on ratings given by other users, in order to ensure that all nodes present on the network have good incentives to remain fair.
