The core technology team of CLIx project was hosted at the gnowledge lab from 2016 till 2019. The design and development of the school server used in the project was designed and developed in the lab.
The GStudio platform used for NROER.gov.in is reconfigured to peform as CMS (Course Management System) and LMS (Learning Management System). 
The very first course for the CLIx project, Invitation to CLIx (i2c) was designed, authored and developed at the lab.
This became a prototype design for the other courses launched through the platform from 2017 onwards. 
The platform and the courses can be accessed from [CLIx Platform](https://clixplatform.tiss.edu/). 

The platform is deployed in more than 500 Govt schools in four states of India  (Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Telangana, and Mizoram) 
Apart from the design and development, the lab trained and transferred the technology to the CLIx 
team through workshops and regular meetings with the technology team. We developed
a decentralized and distributed disk which can be copied and distributed to schools. The
multi-partner CLIx project was awarded [the UNESCO King Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa prize for ICT in Education for the year 2017](https://clix.tiss.edu/clix-wins-ict-in-education-prize-07-03-18/). 

The project won another international award for OER Collaboration award for Excellence 2019, 
under the category resources, tools and practices. This award is from the [Open Education Consortium](https://www.oeconsortium.org/projects/open-education-awards-for-excellence/2019-winners-of-oe-awards/tools-and-practices-awards/).
The award recognises the CLIx collaborative partnership dedicated to developing open education resources of the last five years, 
seeded by the Tata Trusts, involving MIT, USA, State Governments of Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram; 
several Indian Higher Education Institutions: HBCSE (TIFR), NIAS Bangalore, IUCAA, Pune, Mizoram University, Aizawl; NGOs: 
Eklavya, MP; CERP Jaipur; and Corporates: Tata Class Edge. 

The success of knowledge transfer is best demonstrated when the team becomes autonomous and continues with little inputs from the lab.
The core technology team of CLix eventually developed another module using GStudio platform for publishing all the resources developed
through the project as [CLIX-OER](https://clixoer.tiss.edu/).
