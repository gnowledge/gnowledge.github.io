# GNOWSYS and Gstudio


![GNOWSYS logo](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnowsys/gnowsys-logo-revised-small.png)

### Introduction to GNOWSYS

GNOWSYS is a specification for a generic distributed network based
memory/knowledge management. Typically computer memory is managed as a
tree, or as nested arrays. Our attempt in this project is to represent
all forms of declarative and procedural knowledge as a network, and then
develop network processing methods to create and publish knowledge as a
network.

### Node orientated computing

Just as the language LISP provides list oriented computing framework, we
try to model the knowledge as *nodes in a network*. The interpretation
(meaning) of a node depends on the links the node has with other nodes,
and the interpretation of the other *neighbouring* nodes in turn depends
on their network and so on. The nodes are organized and processed
according to a complex data structure called the *neighborhood*, akin to
a frame.

# DOER: Disk of OER

DOER (**Distributed Decentralized DISK of Open Online Ongoing
Engagement Repository**): Our innovations in technology often involve
integrating existing technologies for addressing the needs of remote
locations. We provide fast Internet as well as a bleeding-edge data
center in places where ISPs do not reach. This data center that is
delivered as an inter-operable DISK which provides access to
sophisticated communication and social networking platform for remote
areas. Other similar projects done elsewhere in the world,
e.g. Internet-in-a-Box focus on delivering content. While, we focus on
the remote communities as producers and not merely consumers of
content created elsewhere. Therefore, we package multiple servers that
provide Communication and Production Studio that works off the grid in
any operating system on a single regular desktop machine using
cutting-edge container technology using commodity-ware wireless
(radios).

This disk provides fast internet experience along with collaborative
workspaces with a ledger, analytics, transmitting and syncing
mechanisms to visualize their activities, peer to peer feedback to
generate qualitative and quantitative index of their performance.
These inter-operable disks are currently being piloted and sent to
remote schools in four states in India through the CLIx project in
collaboration with Tata Trusts, TISS and NCERT and we are receiving
encouraging stories and feedback from them. What we are shipping
currently are showcased here:

## Learning Studios: A customized operating system for STEM Education
![Learning Studios DVD distribution](https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/original/2X/2/242f2bc7d543254c36a9a9aa7c5b89d5147ed387.jpeg)

Most mainstream software for education was meant to deliver content to
the student or help the teacher deliver the content. The carefully
curated learning studios packaged by the lab into a DVD do not fall in
that category of software. These are platforms for producers and not
consumers, consistent with the constructionist philosophy adopted by
the lab. They support doing, designing, creating, constructing,
sharing, displaying, and composing culture including language, art,
science, mathematics and technology.  The software bundled inside is
itself created collaboratively by thousands of passionate geeks to
cultivate creativity and social responsibility in society.  The DVD
contains carefully curated applications starting from primary school
to graduate level. The DVD is being distributed to students and
teachers across the country. The lab conducted more than 25 hands-on
workshops based on the DVD across the country. The applications are
customÂ­ized as a part of a free and open source GNU/Linux operating
system. NCERT has adopted the DVD for nationwide distribution and
developing the ICT courses for schools across the country.  The
Learning Studios DVD eventually included the sugar learning platform
which runs on the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC).

## MOOC on Digital Literacy

**Nagarjuna G., Amit Dhakulkar, Chandita Mukherjee, \\

The Digital Literacy course intends to empower the learners to use
digital resources effectively and collaboratively. Digital Literacy is
a core course of the NUSSD (National Unviersity Students Skill
Devleopment) project coordinated by TISS (Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research). The skills acquired during this course will be
lifelong in nature. In Digital Literacy course the approach is
collaborative and project based. In this framework, a series of
challenges will be placed before students which they will have to work
through by doing and discovering. The assessment of the students will
be based on the quality of results they produce and the self-learning
that they demonstrate. Both peer-to-peer and mentor assessment will be
employed in the evaluation of the students. Implemented in this way
the Digital Literacy course borrows the central ideas of open online,
collaborative, peer-2-peer model of learning using connectionist and
constructionist methods.

The Digital Literacy course is planned with certain design principles
in mind. These design principles have construction, collaboration and
the community as central strands around which the course structure is
woven. Since the course itself will be implemented with National
Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers, we found it imperative that the
guiding principles of NSS should also find reflection in the course
structure. The objectives of the NSS programme are strongly connected
to the community around the participating students. In case of Digital
Literacy also the community plays a central role in the projects done
by the participating learners.

This course is delivered to more than 20,000 students across India by
the NUSSD program, and the course is still being offered. [An online archived version of thhe MOOC course is available from here.](http://courses.metastudio.org/courses/gnowledgeLab/DL101/2014/about)

## An Invitation to Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx)

I2C is designed to be an easy and exemplary connected learning experience, facilitated through a specially designed course platform - a social space where collaborative interactions happen. i2C aims to prepare learners for conceptual and investigative engagements in Science, Mathematics and English Communication as offered through CLIx.

More details about initiative can be found [here](https://clix.tiss.edu/curriculum/invitation-to-clix/)
