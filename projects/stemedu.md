# Pedagogical Framework - PBL and Discourse
Project based learning and discourse has been very central to the Gnowledge lab's approach. This is inspired by constructionist, and connectionist models of education. The **pedagogical framework** guiding the design of learning environment is elicited below:
* The best context for learning is written, verbal and expressive conversation in a constructive playful environment. 
* The context for conversation is a research and development project. 
* Bring cultural practices, such as STEM habits, into the foreground, while keeping the content in the background. 
* Learning happens through assimilation and accommodation of knowledge in the form of a network of actions performed by socially networked agents. 
* Knowledge is generated and propagated through recurring action patterns (action schemas), called habits. 
* A collaborative, friendly, safe and negotiable learning environment is required for inclusive education. 
* A learning environment to be kept as close-to-life and as close-to- professional practices as possible. 
* Learning to be made visible to and experienced by the learner.

## Nature of projects
* The projects are interdisciplinary in nature and its development can happen across the 3 workspaces - CUBE, MakerSpace, DigitalStudio.
* The projects focuses on generic and transferable competencies such as fabrication, tinkering, data collection, measurement, calibration, analysis, data visualization, knowledge organization, asking questions, designing experiments, design-thinking, modeling, model-based reasoning, seeking evidence, publication and communication. 
* Citizen science and field projects are deployed outside the studios
* The projects are designed as challenges with minimal instructions to encourage innovation and creativity.
* The activities involved in the projects are going to be framed expansively, where investigation of one facet of the problem could lead to another, thereby positioning the participant to be involved in an ongoing intellectual exercise. This has the potential to nurture a sense of authorship and agency among the participants.

CUBE: Collaboratively Understanding Biology Education, is currently, in the 8th year of operation, this project expanded in its scale and continued to encourage and inspire us.  As a demonstration of the pedagogical principles designed as a part of the gnowledge lab, CUBE initiative stands out as one of our major integrated initiatives, that as multiple implications to STEM education in the country.

The CUBE project started as a 5-week hands-on research experience based on ‘Simple Model Systems’ like daphnia, Drosophila, snails, in the summer of 2012. The first phase saw the participation of only 18 students from 4 different colleges in Mumbai. Working on these simple model systems, the participants engaged in some frontline questions regarding the molecular basis of learning and memory, epigenetics, regeneration, decision-making, biological rhythms, etc. What happened next is more unconventional as this model of undergraduate research proved to be beyond ‘apprenticeship model’ wherein students are trained in a one-time workshop. It showed cascade effect as more and more colleges continued to be roped in as participating colleges and required them to establish ‘simple model systems’ based research labs in their colleges and initiate neighborhood colleges into already expanding CUB research program. These student-centered frugal research labs showed open-ended, interactive, inquiry-driven, collaborative and context-bound biology research undertaken by these students. The model systems and the techniques introduced in these labs are incredibly inexpensive and yet raise sophisticated questions and initiated students into the broader scientific practice wherein they engaged in frontline questions through these simple model systems.

## MakerSpaces (for development projects)
HBCSE has launched a new initiative to support and improve the quality of engagements in the makerspaces and tinkering labs that are being setup in many schools across the country. This makerspace follows the CUBE (Collaborative Understanding of Biology Education) model of project based STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education, which focuses on conversations around making and investigative projects. The engagements emphasize documenting the process of making and investigations as a primary goal, with a lesser emphasis on finishing the project. This design creates sufficient opportunities for all the members to engage in conversations based on written and digital media, which are essential for authentic learning. We developed a sophisticated platform that awards badges based on the activity of each registered user. We regularly conduct workshops for teachers (along with students).

A space for design, making, fabrication, engineering projects. 
Here are the key activities of makerspace:
Design, development of new project challenges in the form of projects and interactive exhibits
Documentation, discussion and sharing on the online platform (metastudio.org)
Research in the area of exploring the potentiality of  makerspace as a learning environment.
Empowering the schools/colleges/institutions to start community makerspace and support them in the endeavor to be self-reliant to do all the above.

Expanding the participatory base of science depends on the
availability of accessible, functional labs and field programs in
schools and colleges. Most Indian schools do not have science,
mathematics and computer labs. In those schools where the labs exist,
they are often not functional. In the colleges where labs exist, they
were mostly used for clearing practical examinations and not for
performing authentic scientific experiments. As a result, providing an
authentic exposure to scientific practices is almost impossible given
the current emphasis on the nature of laboratory practicals in the
curriculum.

This project proposes to remedy the situation by developing
activity-based professional development of teachers (particularly
science teachers) by exposing them to ways to create, manage and use
the labs and field explorations (open citizen science projects). This
exposure and training will be conducted by developing and delivering
Activity Based Collaborative Distributed Massive Open Online Courses
(in short ABCD MOOCs).  Unlike traditional courses, these are ongoing
courses that will be integrated with the teacher professional
development programs (in-service teacher training) by involving
students.  The courses will focus on generic and transferable
competencies such as fabrication, tinkering, data collection,
measurement, calibration, analysis, data visualization, knowledge
organization, asking questions, designing experiments, modeling,
model-based reasoning, seeking evidence, publication and
communication.

All the activities of the above physical spaces will be supported by an online platform called - COOOL STEM Games. (COOOL is Collaborative Open Online and Ongoing Learning to nurture research/STEM practices.) The platform was launched on 15th July 2019 and has now a user base of 1000+ participants. The effort is to make a vibrant community of practice for teachers, students, educators, researchers, parents, or any citizen who can collectively participate in the process of knowledge construction via discussions and attempting to solve project challenges. The team also publishes STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) projects challenges periodically, which are specially designed to inculcate STEM habits among participants, keeping in mind [21st

# CLIx: Connected Learning Initiative 

Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx) a multi-partner project funded by
Tata Trusts and coordinated by Tata Institute of Social Sciences.
Arguably one of the most extensive field-based research study on the
ICT based Science, Mathematics, and Language teaching in Govt Schools
in four different states in India (Telangana, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh,
and Mizoram).  The project started in 2015, the first phase of the
project will end in March 2019.  The project so far is executed in
about 600 schools across the country.  The project started with an
online course (delivered through LAN in the school’s computer lab)
developed for school students, Invitation to Connected Learning Environment (i2c) 
was deployed in the field through a marathon of workshops conducted in 
three different states. The was developed in three languages, English, 
Hindi, and Telugu. We deployed, in collaboration with CLIx team, 
in about 600 schools, trained several hundred teachers trained about 
35 technical field support personnel.   

After the successful run of the online course Invitation to CLIx using
the GStudio server during the first half of the year, it was decided
to use GStudio for other courses developed by other partners of CLIx.
As a result, it transformed into CLIx Course Platform for all
courses. During this process, we started collaborating with Office of
the Digital Learning at MIT Boston, which is a core partner of the
CLIx project. We reached an agreement that MIT team will develop Open
Assessment Tool for authoring questions as well as Open Assessment
Player to administer them.  We successfully integrated these
components to run with GStudio environment using an open standard
interface called DLKIT (Digital Learning Kit) which is a Python
binding for OSID (Open Service Interface Definitions).  MIT provided
the DLKIT and test cases supporting the integration process. These
developments gave GStudio the ability to embed assessments, generate
analytics to track learners performance.  During this period both the
team members visited each other’s labs for face to face coordination
and regular conference calls between the MIT team and the team at the
gnowledge lab.  The platform is continuously updated and is available
online at [https://clixplatform.tiss.edu/](https://clixplatform.tiss.edu/), and the code is published at
[https://github.com/gnowledge/gstudio](https://github.com/gnowledge/gstudio) as DLKIT branch.
The main contribution of the gnowledge lab has been to develop the software of the platform based on the flagship project of the lab (GStudio).

![CLIx Platform Installed in over 540 schools across 4 states in India](https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0ce360844572fdafb71237260944c8f77e16f69e.jpeg)

The multi-partner CLIx project was awarded the **UNESCO King Hamad Bin
Isa Al-Khalifa ICT in Education for the year 2017**.  Award received
2018. 

CLIx also won **Open Collaboration Award for Excellence 2019** from
the Open Education Consortium (OEC). The award says: "A bold and
innovative intervention with global relevance to improve the quality
of teaching and learning in the public education systems in India. The
overarching goal is to demonstrate quality at scale through meaningful
use of new media and digital technologies in resource constrained
contexts."

Gnowledge lab at HBCSE contributes to the CLIx by advising and
assisting CLIx technology team for the design, development,
integration and deployment of CLIx platform – a next generation
digital learning platform which is both a course maker (CMS) and a
course player (LMS). The CLIx platform is powered by gstudio, which is
a node based framework for learning technologies developed at the
Gnowledge lab. The platform hosts all the CLIx students modules and
works both online as well as offline. The lab also developed
installation technology for distribution of the platform in the remote
schools which fosters connected learning in disconnected spaces
through the concept of internet in a box. The team at HBCSE
collaborates with MIT technology team to integrate the Open Assessment
Tool and Open Assessment Client with the platform. The Gnowledge lab
is also involved in the CLIx OER release.

The HBCSE has contributed to CLIx in the design and development of i2C
– a digital literacy course for high school students. The HBCSE staff
actively contribute towards the technology transfer to CLIx
implementation teams by conducting workshops, training teachers and
providing technical support on an ongoing basis.
