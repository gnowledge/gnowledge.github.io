### DIY Gaming Station
![DIY Gaming Station](https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e4cf13b25de6a9cad1ad4851321a14ccaa49a141.png)

DIY gaming station is an array of neopixel LEDs which provides a canvas to design your own game. Its made using arduino and neopixel
LEDs which are can be individually controlled. Currently, we have two games running on it - tetris and snake. There is standalone remote as
well as an app to play the game.The gaming station can enable one to pick up electronics, programming, and fundamentals of physics in an engaging and meaningful manner.

Micro Weather Station is a cost-effective DIY FOSS weather station developed using the Arduino Mega to provide the weather parameters
such as wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. All these readings are visualized in real time.  The data collected might be useful for the further analysis, detecting patterns, plotting graphs, prediction etc.

### AeroPonics

Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium. Here, we have used a PVC pipe to make slots where the plants can be kept. The water is raised up using the motor and then drips through the plants' roots. There is an inbuilt timer which makes the motor switch on and off in a cyclic period of a minute.

In this project, the participants are required to hack the web-camera and invert the front lens to repurpose it a functional digital microscope.
One would be collecting the different water samples and observing it under the DIY microscope.

Instruino is a cost effective DIY FOSS Portable Lab Device developed using the Arduino Mega to measure the parameters such as humidity, ambient temperature and of liquid, pH value, turbidity and light intensity. It is developed for the biology lab where it has important role in conducting experiments and research. The device features the data visualization (on graphs and other widgets) over the internet, connected via its wifi. It also allows the data to get logged into the SD card along with timestamp and also sends the data to be viewed on smartphones via bluetooth. It also features the audio-visual alarm against the threshold set by the user. It can be easily replicated, modified and used by the researchers and students.

### Spectrophotometer

Spectrophotometry is the quantitative measurement of the reflection or transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength. Light from a white light source is split into its components by a monochromator such as a diffraction grating or a prism and directed to an exit slit. Beyond the slit, the selected light color passes through a cuvette holding the test sample and falls on a photo-receptor that allows calculating the absorbance via the Lambert-Beer equation A = -LogI0(I1/I0).
This box spectrophotometer uses diffraction grating and 3D printed parts to make the casing. There is a stepper motor which moves the setup for the scanning i.e passing different wavelengths via the cuvette. The fall in intensity is detected by a photodiode and the data is recorded. To make slits, simple blades are used.

### DIY Centrifuge
![DIY Centrifuge](https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b258334aeae96cd89c3a2aaa1eb9e36a1a72f702.png)

Hard Disk based Centrifuge is a relatively low cost FOSS centrifuge made from scrap hard disk (an e-waste) for DIY biolabs where budget is the main concern. A centrifuge is device which uses the centrifugal forces for separating the different materials suspended in the liquid. As this scrap hard disk are cheaply and easily avialble and also its motor meet the high RPM requirements for the centrifuge. This motor is a brushless DC motor thus requires electronic speed control (ESC) along with  Arduino Nano as controller.
