# turtleArt Chatshaala

HBCSE MakerSpace organised a chatshaala series on "Exploring turtleArt ".

> turtleArt is a great way to explore mathematical and programming concepts embedded in art-making centered context. It is inspired by LOGO, which is an educational programming language, designed by Papert et al. as a constructionist learning environment.

The following concepts were explored in the series:

- understanding turtleBlock/python turtle interface
- Exploring polygons I - variables, loops, conditional statements etc
- Exploring polygons II - nested loops
- Art related coding challenges
- Generative Art

There were two cycles of the turtleArt implemented.
- From 9th June to 25 June: 6 sessions spaced across 3 weeks
- From 23rd June to 7th July: 5 sessions spaced across 3 weeks
