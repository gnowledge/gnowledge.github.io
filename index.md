<h1>chatShaala: a webinar room and an online forum</h1>
<p>chatShaala is a conversational space to nurture and deepen understanding around making and investigative projects. We envision to build an community of students, educators, tinkerers, researchers, teachers, scientists, curious citizens to participate in the process of knowledge construction through dialogue in the context of tinkering and investigations.

#  STEM Habits
**Nurturing and Recognizing STEM habits, bringing Culture to the Foreground of Education**

An R&D laboratory of [HBCSE (Homi Bhabha Centre for Science
Education)](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/), [TIFR (Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research)](https://www.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai, India. The
lab's focus is on *designing and developing discourse based
collaborative constructionist learning environoments AKA studios*. We also
develop, design and distribute information and communication technology for studio based STEM
education and share our research and developed material to the rest of
the world under Creative Commons license.

The unusually spelled term "gnowledge" is an inspiration from the [GNU
project](https://www.gnu.org/). The lab is also unusual for its explicit declaration to a social committment as mentioned in the [gnowledge manifesto](https://www.gnowledge.org/projects/manifesto.html).

## Release of chatshaala.in

[chatShaala.in](https://chatshaala.in/) is a mobile friendly, data efficient web app, with a simplified interface of metaStudio.org. This does not need any installation, and works on all mobiles and Desktops using a normal web browser. It consumes 50% less Internet bandwidth to access [metaStudio.org](http://metaStudio.org) which makes it lean and fast application. [metaStudio.org](http://metaStudio.org) as well as [chatShaala.in](https://chatshaala.in/) both use the same backend, therefore users can continue to use any Interface as per their preference. More details can be found [here](https://www.gnowledge.org/projects/chatshaalaApp.html)
