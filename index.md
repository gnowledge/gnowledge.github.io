# STEM habits in curriculum
**Bringing Culture to the Foreground of Education**

An R&D laboratory of [HBCSE (Homi Bhabha Centre for Science
Education)](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/), [TIFR (Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research)](https://www.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai, India. The
lab's focus is on *designing and developing discourse based
collaborative constructionist learning environoments AKA studios*. We also
develop, design and distribute information and communication technology for studio based STEM
education and share our research and developed material to the rest of
the world under Creative Commons license.

The unusually spelled term "gnowledge" is an inspiration from the [GNU
project](https://www.gnu.org/). The lab is also unusual for its explicit declaration to a social committment as mentioned in the [gnowledge manifesto](https://www.gnowledge.org/projects/manifesto.html).
