<p>chatShaala is a conversational space to nurture and deepen understanding around making and investigative projects. We envision to build a community of students, educators, tinkerers, researchers, teachers, scientists, curious citizens to participate in the process of knowledge construction through dialogue in the context of tinkering and investigations.

#  STEM Habits
**Nurturing and Recognizing STEM habits, bringing Culture to the Foreground of Education**

An R&D laboratory of [HBCSE (Homi Bhabha Centre for Science
Education)](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/), [TIFR (Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research)](https://www.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai, India. The
lab's focus is on *designing and developing discourse based
collaborative constructionist learning environoments AKA studios*. We also
develop, design and distribute information and communication technology for studio based STEM
education and share our research and developed material to the rest of
the world under Creative Commons license.

The unusually spelled term "gnowledge" is an inspiration from the [GNU
project](https://www.gnu.org/). The lab is also unusual for its explicit declaration to a social committment as mentioned in the [gnowledge manifesto](https://www.gnowledge.org/projects/manifesto.html).

## Living Academy
Living Academy (LA) is developing as a studio (a life-long Kindergarten) for home schooling parents and children, and a club-house for children living in an urban slum near Bhavani Peth, Pune, India.  Stories on how the Living Academy is being created is documented at https://metaStudio.org/c/la 

## metaStudio.org 

[metaStudio.org](https://metaStudio.org/) is a mobile friendly platform for chatting cultivating the STEM habits (STEM chatShala).  Students periodically blog here about the various experiments they do at their frugal labs at home or discuss in groups in both private and public spaces.
