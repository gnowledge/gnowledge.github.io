Mumbai, a city in Maharashtra (India) has been the center of the epidemic since the outbreak of COVID-19. The prevailing pandemic has led to the spread of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, both symptomatically and asymptomatically. One of the ways to understand the dynamics of transmission of disease is through  community based serological studies to test for infection. It is important as depending on the level of prevalence of infection, appropriate public health interventions can be planned and implemented for prevention and control of the disease.  A COVID-19 seroprevalence survey study was recently conducted by TIFR scientists. The results of this study are sending shock waves across the world! To get up close and personal insights into the seroprevalence study, we at CovidGyan are in conversation with the scientists. The  part 4 of the article discusses the personal perspectives, risks and challenges during the study, and about public private partnership

Estimating the size of any small object or microorganism is a challenging task for students and teachers. We present a simple method to estimate small sizes and learn to use micron as a unit of measurement. While observing organisms under the microscope, can we also estimate the size of the organisms? Should it be in centimeters or millimeters, or even more minute and tiny than these two units? There are units for observing smaller objects or microorganisms that are too small to see with the naked eye. One of these units is called micron (μ) or micrometer (μm).

In the current outbreak of COVID-19, for a large scale diagnosis it is preferrable that a testing method that is easy, quick, without any sophisticated instrument is made available. A recent study claiming to detect the SARS-CoV-2 with naked eye seems of interest. The method uses gold nanoparticles and colorimetric analysis for detection of the target RNA sequence of  the virus, without use of sophisticated instruments, within 10 min from the isolated RNA samples.

### Figuring the ‘making’ with Indian teachers: Can we re-imagine STEM learning?

Karnam, DP., Sinha, R., & Pardeshi, A.,  Abstracts (with oral presentations) & Poster.   "Figuring the ‘making’ with Indian teachers: Can we re-imagine STEM learning?". In Gresalfi M., & Horn, I. S. (Eds.). Proceedings of The Interdisciplinarity of the Learning Sciences, 14th The International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) 2020, Volume 4. (pp. 2339-2340), Nashville, Tennessee: (Online): International Society of the Learning Sciences. June 21, 2020.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">There is a recent interest among education researchers and a push by policymakers towards making, due to a converging acknowledgement of its potential in improving learning. In India too, there is a push in creating maker spaces in schools. However, there is a limited realisation of the potential possibly due to the limited understanding of this in the teachers. Here, we attempt to engage with the teachers in a meaningful way. This paper captures the initial understanding of making in a cohort of 21 science and 19 mathematics teachers of government schools in India. Further, it highlights the nuances in the understanding of the making culture (developing a framework) and its broader implications after reflecting on the video prompt and collective discussion with the teachers. Using this evidence of teachers eliciting subtleties of learning and making culture, we argue for a greater possibility of and a need for meaningful teacher-researcher engagement for reimagining learning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Students and adults struggle to understand the explanations of simple astronomical phenomena. Research has shown that much of the difficulty lies with students’ difficulty to use visuospatial reasoning. Drawing on research on embodied cognition, multimodality and multimedia learning, a short pedagogic sequence called ‘Basic Astronomy module’ was designed around multiple external representations such as concrete models, gestures, roleplays, animations, interactive digital games and diagrams. In the present study, we closely monitored the implementation of the module by seven teachers in government schools in Jaipur district of Rajasthan, India to study the teaching-learning process through the module and its effectiveness. In this paper,we will document the learning outcomes of the module in terms of conceptual understanding, attitudes and beliefs. Results show that students ’understanding of basic astronomy concepts improved significantly after completion of the module; Additionally, students’ beliefs and attitudes towards science and specifically towards astronomy changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Many teaching-learning applications have a computer-mediated sharing feature and it is important that we study its role in the teaching-learning process in detail. The present study, which is a part of the   larger   study,   probes   the   impact   of   the   computer-mediated   sharing   feature   on   classroom activities. 45 students who belonged to a 4th-grade classroom were divided into two groups. One group has worked on a version of a digital game where each student played with the computer individually, whereas another group has worked on the version where a group of students played with each other mediated by networked computers. One classroom session from each setting was video recorded and analyzed. In this paper, we present the findings of the video analysis.</p>

### Populating India with STEM Spectators: GullyCricket Model of Spreading STEM Culture


Prof M C Arunan, "Populating India with STEM Spectators: GullyCricket Model of Spreading STEM Culture", CUBE Lab, Homi Bhabha Center for Science Education, TIFR, Mumbai, 2020.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">In India, there is a serious dearth of spectators for Science, unlike, say, in a game of cricket. A game like Cricket is a rule-following activity where the players as well as the spectators are immersed in it. The idea was to see if Indian science can learn anything from Indian street cricket. With this aim a new model of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education called CUBE (Collaboratively Understanding Biology Education) was launched 6 years ago at the Homi Bhabha Center. STEM is taken as a set of games scientists, engineers and mathematicians play. The idea is to develop groups of people who understood some rules of the game and they would constitute the STEM spectators. For creating the STEM spectators, groups of students and teachers working in collaboration were encouraged to do experiments using the resourcesin their neighborhood on problems that they observe in their everyday life. Several such groups in under graduate colleges and schools across the country were set up. Prof Arunan narrated examples of such experiments as the pea study, the Dafnia study, the flowering patterns of mangoes in different geographical locations etc. It was observed that some of these studies matured from curiosity to frontier sciences.</p>

[Download the PDF file](assets/Reconstruction_of_Phenomena_through_STEM_Games.pdf)
 

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">As a part of the STEM games, scientists have been involved in searching for the building blocks and cement for reconstructing natural phenomena. This reconstruction happens in an artificially constructed experimental “microworlds”. And in this reconstruction process, the author argues, that scientists have always been employing technology, engineering, and mathematics. The evidence for the truths in science is situated in the socially reconstructed experimental process of natural phenomena, and cannot be obtained in isolation.</p>

We often speak about the sorry state of
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) and STEM education in India. We
recognize the problem, but do not appear to have a
strategy to improve the situation. This is not to say
there are no honest attempts at improvement, but
they have, at best, worked in minimal conditions.
In this short note, we present a model-driven picture
with the hope that this may help us understand the
problem and, hopefully, find a road toward good
STEM policy and practice. [Also published as a blog here, where you can discuss and comment.](https://x.metastudio.org/t/the-stem-games/145)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> This article is on the
politics of media, covering both digital and non-digital media. The
primary purpose of this short article is to bring home the point that
the current political powers, all around the world, are using the
‘new’ digital medium to make ‘old’ governing systems more powerful,
rather than empowering citizens, although most of the governments of
nations themselves claim to sustain and work towards democracy. We
will discuss centralised regulation and decentralised regulation of
media, and relate this to the concepts of copyright and copy left . A
political movement has taken shape to address the issue, which is
called free software movement , and this has inescapable implications
to several aspects of our lives, wherever digitisation of culture
impacts and effects. [Also published as a blog here, where you can

### Instant Sharing in Computer Aided Classroom
Rafikh Shaikh, Harshit Agrawal, Nagarjuna G., and Mrunal Nachankar, "Instant Sharing Makes Task More Engaging in Computer Aided Classroom", Proceedings of CSCL, pp. 609-612 2017. [Download PDF file](assets/CSCL2017-Rafikh.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> With the advent of
networked computers sharing of information and artifacts have become
very convenient. From online multi-player games to social networking
sites, instant sharing has become the norm of the day. Educational
tools are trying to harness sharing as a potential tool to engage
students in learning processes. But, does sharing lead to an
improvement in academic performance? The present study investigates
the role of instant sharing in the context of learning in a classroom
setting. Two groups of students, from a suburban school in Mumbai,
India, played an arithmetic game over a period of 7-8 months.  The
experimental group played on a platform that supported instant
sharing, while the platform for the control group was standalone. All
other aspects of both platforms were same.  Analysis of process data
of the two groups reveals that instant sharing increased engagement
with the game. Students from control group lost interest in the game
after some days, while experimental group students remained active on
it till the end of the four-month period.</p>

Most of the ideas in this article have come from SeymourPapert, the
main proponent of constructionism. Papert passed away in 2016 after
meeting with a near fatal accident a fewyears ago. We use parables and
ideas from Papert and our experience with children, computers and
constructionism to make arguments in this article. A few years ago
after a talk which exemplified the use ofcomputers in novel ways, one
of the authors (Amit Dhakulkar)was asked this question (not verbatim,
but close): “So, considering that the activity that you have
designed requires a computer and expEYES (an indigenous hardware for
collecting data), how can you scale it up to schools which have
millions of children?” The author was expecting this question and the
short answer to that was: “You give a million computers to a
million children!”</p>

### Semantic Reference Set of Linking Words for Concept Mapping in Biology

Meena Kharatmal and G. Nagarjuna, "Using Semantic Reference Set of Linking Words for Concept Mapping in Biology", In A. Canas, P. Reiska & J. Novak (Eds.) *Innovating with concept mapping. Communications in computer and information science series (Vol. 635, pp. 315-329). Springer International Publisher.*, 2016. [Download PDF file](assets/Using-Semantic-Reference-Set-of-Linking-Words-for-Concept-Mapping-in-Biology-2016.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> Inspired by the semantic network studies we propose additional conventions for choosing linking words and arrive at a Reference Set of semantically well-defined linking words drawn from the Knowledge Representation area of research in the domain of biology. Each linking word in the set is assigned a dimension: part-whole, class-inclusion, spatial-inclusion, function and attribution. We study expert representations by content analysis of biology texts at three levels of increasing subject complexity. We compare the linking words used in these representations with the Reference Set and find an increasing degree of proximity to the latter. This indicates that experts tend touse more well-defined linking words. Regarding this proximity as a characteristic of expertise, we can encourage novices to re-represent their concept maps using the linking words from the Reference Set. We discuss the implications of the approach for science education.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">

We designed a simple teaching/learning activity from real life using
commonly available mustard seeds as an introduction to mathematical
modelling, using a cluster of trans- disciplinary skills and concepts.
As a first exercise for middle or high school students in indirect
measurement using physical and mathematical modelling, we present here
a simple task where students are asked to find the average diameter of
mustard seeds. The resulting observations lead to a simple linear
mathematical model which has accessible physical basis from the real
world. This simple task also provides a rich opportunity and a context
to learn several topics in measurement, modelling, graphicacy and
statistics. We present this as a template to be used for developing a
series of activities for learning indirect measurements, physical and
mathematical models.

### Finite-size effects in the dependency networks of FOSS

Rajiv  Nair, G.  Nagarjuna and  Arnab  K.  Ray, "Finite-size effects in the dependency networks of free and open-source software", *Complex Systems, Vol. 23*, 2014. [Download PDF file](assets/complexsystems.pdf)
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We  propose  a  continuum  model  for  the  degree  distribution of  directed  networks  in  free  and  open-source software. The degree distributions of links in both the in-directed and out-directed dependency networks follow Zipf’s law for the intermediate nodes, but the heavily linked nodes and the poorly linked nodes deviate from this trend and exhibit finite-size effects.  The finite-size parameters make a quantitative distinction between the in-directed and out-directed networks. For the out-degree distribution, the initial condition for a dynamic evolution corresponds to the limiting count of the most heavily liked nodes that the out-directed network can finally have. The number of nodes contributing out-directed links grows with every generation of software release, but this growth ultimately saturates towards a terminal value due tothe finiteness of semantic possibilities in the network.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Textbook biology knowledge is being represented as triples using
concept maps. These triples can be extended to create concept lattices
by representing objects and attributes in relation. By focusing on the
nature of semantic relations, concept neighbourhood lattices can be
generated for dependencies, associations. By representing the changes
in the attributes of objects in time, concept lattices of dynamic
propositions can be generated. As the knowledge base for the study is
textbook biology, this research on using concept lattices in school,
college biology education can be further developed with focusing on
teaching learning, cognitive assessment.</p>

### Towards a Model of Life and Cognition

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">This essay is an attempt to answer the question: What should be the ontological
foundation/s of the world that makes living and cognitive beings possible? For
natural scientists this question can be translated to: What are the basic assumptions needed to build a science of life and cognition? It is possible to deal with
the questions pertaining to life and cognition independently, but the point of
addressing them together is due to an increasing awareness among scholars
that they share a similar if not an identical foundation. Since I consider this
connection between life and cognition a great insight, I would like to pursue
further to explore the deeper interdependence in this essay. Most of the essay
is a description of a hypothetical but a logically possible world with a defined
ontological base, followed by indicating how a model based on the alternative
foundations can indeed explain the actual world.</p>

### Representing Change Using Concept Maps

Meena Kharatmal & Nagarjuna G., "Representing Change Using Concept Maps", *Proceedings of epiSTEME 5, International Conference to Review Research on Science, TEchnology and Mathematics Education* 2013. [Download PDF file](assets/Representing-Change-Using-Concept-Maps-2013.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">While concept maps have been quite extensively used to represent static descriptions, it has not been used for its full potential for representing changes or processes. We propose a template and a limited set of linking phrases for representing change, with partial amendments in the concept mapping technique and the CmapTools. Usually, a process is represented in a object-centric manner specifying the object’s role in it. In this proposal, we suggest a process-centric strategy with certain heuristics for representing processes. Considering the view that a process is a name to a change of state of an object involving time, sequence, causes, we make necessary proposals to the vocabulary and the form of representing a process. We end with a discussion on implications of this proposal to science education and concept mapping in general.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> We report an exploratory study that examined the educational possibilities through a verbal messaging application (chat), and show that this activity has the potential for effectively teaching mathematical concepts. Communicating in a virtual chat room allows children to become literate, as well as situate themselves in a social environment. Because of the latter possibility, children look forward to this activity with lot of motivation and interest. We modified some rules of the virtual chat room in the Sugar Learning Platform to facilitate development of arithmetic skills like addition, subtraction and multiplication. We present the highlights of this chat room experiment, and outline the insights gained from the analysis of the logs collected over five months from a group of 15 tribal village students (3rd and 4th grade). </p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Constructing, reading and understanding graphs is an inter disciplinary and important skill in today’s world. Though being such an important skill students are not taught explicitly to develop this important skill. Also there has been an urge in the literature for the students to use real world data to make sense ofthe concepts that they learn. In general students are not provided with opportunities to make the skill explicit, and link it up with their life experiences the concepts and subjects that they learn. We present here a simple task which provides the students a context in which real world data is collected, and used to construct a simple linear mathematical model. This task connects different skills like measurement, graphicacy, mathematical modelling and at the same time also helps a two way transition between the abstract mathematical world and the concrete physical world.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We  propose  a  mathematical  model  to  fit  the  degree  distribution  of  directed  dependency networks  in  free  and  open-source  software.   In  this  complex  system,  the  intermediate  scales  of  both the in-directed and out-directed dependency networks follow a power-law trend (specifically Zipf’s law). Deviations from this feature are found both for the highly linked nodes, and the poorly linked nodes.  This is due to finite-size effects in the networks, and the parameters needed to model finite-size behaviour make a quantitative distinction between the in-directed and out-directed networks.  We also provide a model to describe the dynamic evolution of the network, and account for its saturation in the long-time limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We present here an analysis of school textbooks with graphs and  related  activities  as  the  point  of  focus.  The  sample textbooks that we have considered for the analysis are NCERT textbooks  (from  Grade  5  to  Grade  10,  in  the  subjects  of Science,  Mathematics  and  Social  Sciences).  A  quantitative analysis  is  done  on  frequency  of  occurrence,  types  and features of the graphs present in the different textbooks. We observe that the graphs are under-represented in the school textbooks. Considering the importance of the ability to read, construct  and  interpret  graphs  in  science  and  mathematics education we recommend strongly that in the future edition of textbooks graphs should be properly represented.</p>

We propose in this paper a simple method to construct a machine
processable semantic network, called a dependency network, that
gathers all the concepts and skills as nodes and the relation type
“depends on”, (and its inverse “required for”), as their edges. As a
conceptual structure can be used to compute a roadmap of any learning-
teaching objective. As a prelude we build and contribute a seed graph

contributing, publishing and dynamically building dependency
networks. A possible generalization of this methodology for knowledge

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> Although concept maps have been found to be effective inscience education research, these are critiqued for being informal dueto informal usage of relation and attribute names thereby resulting inambiguity. Refined concept mapping, a development over the regular con-cept mapping is an approach towards introducing rigor and parsimony inrepresenting knowledge. The method proposed suggests to substitute theambiguous relation names with well-defined relation names to conceptsconsistently while mapping a domain. We suggest the use of this methodfor introducing rigor in concept mapping and position it among the othermodels of knowledge representation in an inverse semantic spectrum.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">A nonlinear model has been posited for the global analysis of data pertaining to the semantic network of a complex operating system (free and open-source software). While the distribution of links in the dependency network of this system is scale-free for the intermediate nodes, the richest nodes deviate from this trend, and exhibit a nonlinearity-induced saturation effect. This also distinguishes the two directed networks of incoming and outgoing links from each other. The initial condition for a dynamic model, evolving towards the steady dependency distribution, determines the saturation properties of the mature scale-free network</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> Students' understanding of science has been of considerable importance in the area of science education research. It tries to focus on issues such as conceptual understanding, teaching of science, students' knowledge structure, tools that can aid in their understanding of science, etc. Concept map is one such tool that is being used to elicit students' knowledge and teaching and learning in a given domain. Concept maps are two-dimensional, hierarchical, node-link diagrams that depict knowledge. This article presents a review of concept maps in science education research with an illustration of a case study on the effectiveness of concept maps for eliciting students' knowledge structure from the domain of cell biology. The study used two different methods---description and concept maps---for depicting students' knowledge. The study depicts a significant increase in the depiction of concepts and propositions using the concept mapping method as compared to the description method.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> Refined  concept  map  (RCM)  is  comprised  of  node  names and a well-defined, invariant, minimal set of relation names. Using  RCM  as  a  methodology,  it  can  be  applied  to  study the changes in the knowledge structure, as a tool for analysis of forms of representations. In this paper, we discuss the study conducted to test the ease and feasibility of RCM by comparing it with other modes of representation. A homo-geneous sample of school students were assigned the same task from a specific domain. The analysis shows that it was easy and feasible to use RCM by the school students. The fixed set of relation names, does not affect the expression of  knowledge  and  at  the  same  time  helps  in  representing accurate knowledge. The constraints in the RCM served as an anchoring and a facilitator  for  representing  scientific knowledge.</p>

### Semantic structure in scale-free dependency networks of FOSS

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> A continuum model has been proposed to fit the data pertaining to the directed networks in free and open-source software.  While the degree distributions of links in both the in-directed and out-directed dependency networks follow Zipf’s law for the intermediate nodes, the most richly linked nodes, as well as the most poorly linked nodes, deviate from this trend and exhibit finite-size effects. The finite-size parameters make a quantitative distinction between the in-directed and out-directed networks. Dynamic evolution of free software releases shows that the finite-size properties of the in-directed and out-directed networks are opposite in nature. For the out-degree distribution, the initial condition for a dynamic evolution also corresponds to the limiting count of rich nodes that the mature out-directed network can have. The number of nodes contributing out-directed links grows with each passing generation of software release,  but this growth ultimately saturates towards a finite value due to the finiteness of semantic possibilities in the network.</p>

going into the technical and economic reasons. To begin with I will introduce the special nature of
digital resources, and why in this new digital society and what we need to know about it. Later, I will
begin by explaining the term ‘free software’ and its relation to the culture of copyleft, followed by the
history of free software movement, and how it is different from the open source software. I will then
clear the doubts people often have regarding the possibility of a business, and the motivation of the
people who come forward to contribute to free software. Then I will turn my attention to the core
issue of why software and knowledge should be free, and how dangerous proprietary software is to
human culture. We will also see how proprietary software companies are working with Government
and educational institutions to take hold of the power, and how we can fight this evil nexus. Free
software is an eminent choice for education, and is an ethical and political choice to exercise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Traditionally questions in epistemology took for granted the uniqueness of the human being, and
therefore questions were raised about the relationship between the knowing being (subject) and the nature (environment), the object. How does the subject understand/explain the natural phenomena
around it? How does the subject establish the true knowledge and how does it arrive at such
knowledge? Although were not ill­posed, these questions bank on the wedge between human mind
and nature, a dualism. Even though traditional materialist positions denied such dualism, they yet
granted that mind as an emergent property is unique and that its emergence is to be understood on a
materialist basis. Athough the dominant discourses in philosophy continue to remain in the same
mold, ecological and evolutionary approaches of mind began to mature, particularly during the last
four decades (Bateson 1979). The ecological approach first considers human being as a component
of nature, with other living beings as our cognitive fellow beings. With this standpoint the kind of
questions that one may ask in epistemology takes a new turn: How does one part of nature begin to
know the other components of nature? How does one part of nature begin to know about itself?
What is an object that a subject may know it, and what are the subjects, that they may know an
object? These questions thus are based on the assumption that we as cognitive agents are natural:
that is Mind in Nature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> During the course of
science education one of the recognizable and desirable changes from a
novice to an expert is in their language (knowledge
representation). One noticeable change is that of weeding out
ambiguous expressions bringing in clarity and rigor. However, this
happens not by weeding out the concept names but by choosing more and
more accurate linking words (relation names). By focusing on the
relation names we report the results of a preliminary study that
confirms that subject experts increasingly chose relation names
(linking words) that come closer to formal descriptions. The
significance of this observation to concept mapping community as well
as to cognitive development is immense, for it provides a simple and
effective method to study conceptual change, validates the use of
refined concept maps in place of the traditional technique in science
education, and also further strengthens the approach that relationship
between nodes determine the semantics, and not the nodes per se.

### Layers in the Fabric of Mind: A Critical Review of Cognitive Ontogeny

G. Nagarjuna, "Layers in the Fabric of Mind: A Critical Review of Cognitive Ontogeny" , *In Research Trends in Science, Technology and Mathematics Education,J. Ramadas and S. Chunawala, Eds. Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education,TIFR*, 2006. [Download PDF file](assets/28-layers-episteme1.pdf)
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">The focus in this essay is on metasystem transitions: from biologically rooted procedural knowledge to socially rooted declarative knowledge. Another fundamental transition, from folklore to science, will be alluded to while drawing the picture of the layers in the fabric of mind towards the end.</p>

### Muscularity of Mind: Transition from Unconscious to Conscious

Nagarjuna G., "Muscularity of Mind: Towards an Explanation of the Transition from Unconscious to Conscious", *in Annual Conference of European Society for Philosophy and Psychology (ESPS), in Lund, Sweden, http://cogprints.Org/4352,* 2005.  [Download PDF file](assets/8-mom.pdf)
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">The title Muscularity of Mind indicates the point of view that is argued in this essay. I attempt to trace the roots of higher cognitive abilities to the physiological coupling that exists between neuro-sensory and muscular system. Most of the current discourses on the subject base their studies more on the nervous and sensory dimensions, neglecting the most crucial of all, the role of voluntary muscles in shaping the higher cognitive abilities. I make a claim that emancipation of voluntary muscles from the mandatory biological functions to take on the softer habits during the course of evolution played the crucial role in shaping the higher cognitive abilities. I undertake to explain the transition from procedural to declarative representation by hypothesizing that softer operations that a repeculiar to higher cognitive agents in the evolutionary order are rooted in the physiological nexus between neuro-sensory and muscular subsystems of the cognitive agent.The objective of this essay is to indicate that the problem cannot be solved without attending to this nexus.

### Information and Knowledge Management Using GNOWSYS

Meena Kharatmal, Sandhya R. and Nagarjuna G., "Information and Knowledge Management Using GNOWSYS", *Conference Proceedings. Recent Advances in Information Technology*, p.160, 2005. [Download PDF file](assets/Information-and-Knowledge-Management-Using-GNOWSYS-2005.pdf) 

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> GNOWSYS (Gnowledge
Networking and Organizing System), a generic system for semantic
computing, is a free-software developed at Homi Bhabha Centre for
Science Education (Tata Institute of Fun- damental Research), and is
released as an official GNU project. It is specially made for
publishing vocabularies, propositions, ontologies, complex systems,
web services, semantic computing and such infor- mative resources
including library resources on the web. It is designed keeping in mind
the recent developments in semantic computing and knowledge
representation. It is a hybrid database system with distributed,
hierarchical, object-oriented, relational database support. It can
serve as an information grid, it can export data in regular seman- tic
web standards such as OWL, XTM, and its native GNOWML. It can be used
for creating digital encyclopedia, thesauri, dictionaries, glossaries,
multi-lingual databases, for building e-learning applications, etc. A
unique feature of GNOWSYS is its potential to publish knowledge at the
ultimate granular level (terms and predicates of propositions). In
this paper, we shall demonstrate a case study of using GNOWSYS for
library management and for knowledge management.

### GNOWSYS: A System for Semantic Computing

Nagarjuna G., "GNOWSYS: A System for Semantic Computing", *Homi Bhabha centre for Science Education, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,* 2005. [Download PDF file](assets/39-conceptPaper.pdf)
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> The purpose of this essay is to introduce a heterogeneous computing environment with a possibility of semantic and formal annotations, covering the motivation, architecture, and functionality of the system called GNOWSYS(Gnowledge Networking and Organizing System). GNOWSYS is a system to specify, publish and query about multi-plelogics, ontologies, and epistemologies. Its kernel includes three semantic layers with increasing order of semantic specification, three groups of component classes for storing objects of various complexity in the knowledge base, and three levels of generality with objects belonging to tokens,types and metatypes. It has component classes for representing both declarative and procedural knowledge, and the latter specification is  executable enabling semantic and visual computing. It is specially made for publishing vocabularies, propositions, ontologies, complex systems, webservices, with or without formal annotation. Its architecture is not frozen, and is still actively taking shape. Hence a purpose of this communication is also a request for comments.</p>

### Understanding Science Through Knowledge Organizers

Research on Science, Technology and Mathematics Education, pp. 13–17*, 2004. [Download PDF file](assets/Understanding-Science-Through-Knowledge-Organizers-An-Introduction-2004.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We propose, in this paper,  a teaching program based on a grammar of scientific language borrowed mostly from the area of knowledge representation in computer science and logic. The paper introduces an operationizable framework for understanding knowledge using knowledge representation(KR) methodology. We start with organizing concepts based on their cognitive function, followed by assigning valid and authentic semantic relations to the concepts. We propose that in science education, students can understand better if they organize their knowledge using the KR principles. The process, we claim, can help them to align their conceptual framework with that of experts 'conceptual framework which we assume is the goal of science education.</p>
