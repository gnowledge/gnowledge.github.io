### A Slate for Every Child
Amit Dhakulkar, Rafikh Shaikh, "A slate for every child: rethinking
education in the age of computers" *Teacher Plus Magazine*, 15. 30-33,
May-June 2017. [Download PDF file](assets/A-slate-for-every-child_ rethinking-education-in-the-age-of-computers.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Most of the ideas in this article have come from SeymourPapert, the
main proponent of constructionism. Papert passed away in 2016 after
meeting with a near fatal accident a fewyears ago. We use parables and
ideas from Papert and our experience with children, computers and
constructionism to make arguments in this article. A few years ago
after a talk which exemplified the use ofcomputers in novel ways, one
of the authors (Amit Dhakulkar)was asked this question (not verbatim,
but close): “So, considering that the activity that you have
designed requires a computer and expEYES (an indigenous hardware for
collecting data), how can you scale it up to schools which have
millions of children?” The author was expecting this question and the
short answer to that was: “You give a million computers to a
million children!”</p>

## Justice in a Digital Society

Nagarjuna G., "Distributing Justice in a Digital Society", *Breakthrough: A Journal for Science and Society*, Volume 20, Issue 3, Breakthrough Science Society, 2018. [Download PDF file](assets/mediaPolitics-11-10-2018 .pdf) 

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> This article is on the
politics of media, covering both digital and non-digital media. The
primary purpose of this short article is to bring home the point that
the current political powers, all around the world, are using the
‘new’ digital medium to make ‘old’ governing systems more powerful,
rather than empowering citizens, although most of the governments of
nations themselves claim to sustain and work towards democracy. We
will discuss centralised regulation and decentralised regulation of
media, and relate this to the concepts of copyright and copy left . A
political movement has taken shape to address the issue, which is
called free software movement , and this has inescapable implications
to several aspects of our lives, wherever digitisation of culture
impacts and effects. [Also published as a blog here, where you can

## Measuring the Mustard Seed

Amit Dhakulkar, Nagarjuna G, and Samir Dhurde, "Measuring the
 mustard seed: an exercise in indirect measurement and mathematical
 modelling", *School Science Review*, Number **356**, p. 063-068, 2015. [Download PDF file](assets/37-measuring-the-mustard-seed-after-referee-changes.pdf)


<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">

We designed a simple teaching/learning activity from real life using
commonly available mustard seeds as an introduction to mathematical
modelling, using a cluster of trans- disciplinary skills and concepts.
As a first exercise for middle or high school students in indirect
measurement using physical and mathematical modelling, we present here
a simple task where students are asked to find the average diameter of
mustard seeds. The resulting observations lead to a simple linear
mathematical model which has accessible physical basis from the real
world. This simple task also provides a rich opportunity and a context
to learn several topics in measurement, modelling, graphicacy and
statistics. We present this as a template to be used for developing a
series of activities for learning indirect measurements, physical and
mathematical models.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
We often speak about the sorry state of
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) and STEM education in India. We
recognize the problem, but do not appear to have a
strategy to improve the situation. This is not to say
there are no honest attempts at improvement, but
they have, at best, worked in minimal conditions.
In this short note, we present a model-driven picture
with the hope that this may help us understand the
problem and, hopefully, find a road toward good
STEM policy and practice. [Also published as a blog here, where you can discuss and comment.](https://x.metastudio.org/t/the-stem-games/145)

Using the methodology of Refined Concept Mapping, we re-
represent the domain of cell biology of secondary and higher
secondary levels of textbooks. In this study, we demonstrate
that although the number of concept terms increase
progressively, the predicate terms achieve constancy
depicting a finite set. This indicates that for acquiring
expertise in a domain, a finite set of predicate terms is
sufficient. In this paper, we illustrate the methodology and
discuss the pedagogical implications of the study.</p>

## Primer for Conceptual Structures

G.Nagarjuna and M. Kharatmal, “Proposal for developing a primer for
constructing and analyzing conceptual structures,” in *Proceedings
of the 19th international conference on Conceptual structures for
discovering knowledge*, 2011, pp. 402–405. [Download PDF file](assets/A-Proposal-for-Developing-a-Primer-for-Constructing-and-Analyzing-Conceptual-Structures-2011.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
A rationale and proposal for developing a primer for teaching-learning
of conceptual structures is presented. The skills re- quired and
developed by an engagement of constructing and analyzing conceptual
structures are richer and easier to be dealt with in school
education. The teaching-learning context of CS is fundamental and im-
portant enough to introduce the topics from logic, philosophy,
computer science and linguistics. A proposal is made for the formation
of a special interest group for the primer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Textbook biology knowledge is being represented as triples using
concept maps. These triples can be extended to create concept lattices
by representing objects and attributes in relation. By focusing on the
nature of semantic relations, concept neighbourhood lattices can be
generated for dependencies, associations. By representing the changes
in the attributes of objects in time, concept lattices of dynamic
propositions can be generated. As the knowledge base for the study is
textbook biology, this research on using concept lattices in school,
college biology education can be further developed with focusing on
teaching learning, cognitive assessment.</p>

## Refining Concept Mapping

Meena Kharatmal and G. Nagarjuna, A Prposal to Refine Concept Mapping
for Effective Science Learning, in *Concept Maps: Theory, Methodology,

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Concept maps are found to be useful in eliciting knowledge, meaningful
learning, evaluation of understanding and in studying the nature of
changes taking place during cognitive development, particularly in the

for learning science. We agree with the claim, but the effectiveness
will improve only if we gradually introduce a certain amount of
discipline in constructing the maps. The discipline is warranted, we
argue, because science thrives to be an unambiguous and rigorously
structured body of knowledge. Since learning science may be seen as a
process where a novice is expected to be transformed into an expert,
we use the context of learning science for making the
proposal. Further, we identify certain anomalies in the evaluation of
concept maps, and suggest that the evaluation should be based on
semantics of the linking words (relation types) and not on graphical
criteria alone.</p>

## Teaching Learning Sequences

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
We propose in this paper a simple method to construct a machine
processable semantic network, called a dependency network, that
gathers all the concepts and skills as nodes and the relation type
“depends on”, (and its inverse “required for”), as their edges. As a
conceptual structure can be used to compute a roadmap of any learning-
teaching objective. As a prelude we build and contribute a seed graph
for demonstration and introduce a collaborative portal for
contributing, publishing and dynamically building dependency
networks. A possible generalization of this methodology for knowledge
organization is discussed.</p>

## Eliciting Students' Understanding
Meena Kharatmal, "Concept Mapping for Eliciting Students' Understanding of Science, *Indian Educational Review* Vol. 45, No.2, July 2009. [Download PDF file](assets/Concept-Mapping-for-Eliciting-Students-Understanding-of-Science-2009.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> Students' understanding of science has been of considerable importance in the area of science education research. It tries to focus on issues such as conceptual understanding, teaching of science, students' knowledge structure, tools that can aid in their understanding of science, etc. Concept map is one such tool that is being used to elicit students' knowledge and teaching and learning in a given domain. Concept maps are two-dimensional, hierarchical, node-link diagrams that depict knowledge. This article presents a review of concept maps in science education research with an illustration of a case study on the effectiveness of concept maps for eliciting students' knowledge structure from the domain of cell biology. The study used two different methods---description and concept maps---for depicting students' knowledge. The study depicts a significant increase in the depiction of concepts and propositions using the concept mapping method as compared to the description method.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> With the advent of
networked computers sharing of information and artifacts have become
very convenient. From online multi-player games to social networking
sites, instant sharing has become the norm of the day. Educational
tools are trying to harness sharing as a potential tool to engage
students in learning processes. But, does sharing lead to an
improvement in academic performance? The present study investigates
the role of instant sharing in the context of learning in a classroom
setting. Two groups of students, from a suburban school in Mumbai,
India, played an arithmetic game over a period of 7-8 months.  The
experimental group played on a platform that supported instant
sharing, while the platform for the control group was standalone. All
other aspects of both platforms were same.  Analysis of process data
of the two groups reveals that instant sharing increased engagement
with the game. Students from control group lost interest in the game
after some days, while experimental group students remained active on
it till the end of the four-month period.</p>

## Roots of rigor

Meena Kharatmal & Nagarjuna G., "Exploring Roots of Rigor: A Proposal of a Methodology for Analyzing the
Conceptual Change from a Novice to an Expert", in *Concept Mapping: Connecting Educators
Proc. of the Third Int. Conference on Concept Mapping*  A. J. Cañas, P. Reiska, M. Åhlberg & J. D. Novak, Eds.
Tallinn, Estonia & Helsinki, Finland 2008 [Download PDF file](assets/Exploring-Roots-of-Rigor-A-Proposal-of-a-Methodology-for-Analyzing-the-Conceptual-Change-from-Novice-to-an-Expert-2008.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> During the course of
science education one of the recognizable and desirable changes from a
novice to an expert is in their language (knowledge
representation). One noticeable change is that of weeding out
ambiguous expressions bringing in clarity and rigor. However, this
happens not by weeding out the concept names but by choosing more and
more accurate linking words (relation names). By focusing on the
relation names we report the results of a preliminary study that
confirms that subject experts increasingly chose relation names
(linking words) that come closer to formal descriptions. The
significance of this observation to concept mapping community as well
as to cognitive development is immense, for it provides a simple and
effective method to study conceptual change, validates the use of
refined concept maps in place of the traditional technique in science
education, and also further strengthens the approach that relationship
between nodes determine the semantics, and not the nodes per se.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> GNOWSYS (Gnowledge
Networking and Organizing System), a generic system for semantic
computing, is a free-software developed at Homi Bhabha Centre for
Science Education (Tata Institute of Fun- damental Research), and is
released as an official GNU project. It is specially made for
publishing vocabularies, propositions, ontologies, complex systems,
web services, semantic computing and such infor- mative resources
including library resources on the web. It is designed keeping in mind
the recent developments in semantic computing and knowledge
representation. It is a hybrid database system with distributed,
hierarchical, object-oriented, relational database support. It can
serve as an information grid, it can export data in regular seman- tic
web standards such as OWL, XTM, and its native GNOWML. It can be used
for creating digital encyclopedia, thesauri, dictionaries, glossaries,
multi-lingual databases, for building e-learning applications, etc. A
unique feature of GNOWSYS is its potential to publish knowledge at the
ultimate granular level (terms and predicates of propositions). In
this paper, we shall demonstrate a case study of using GNOWSYS for
library management and for knowledge management.

## Rigor in Concept Maps

Meena Kharatmal and G. Nagarjuna, "Introducing Rigor in Concept Maps", 2010. [Download PDF file](assets/Introducing-Rigor-in-Concept-Maps-2010.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> Although concept maps have been found to be effective inscience education research, these are critiqued for being informal dueto informal usage of relation and attribute names thereby resulting inambiguity. Refined concept mapping, a development over the regular con-cept mapping is an approach towards introducing rigor and parsimony inrepresenting knowledge. The method proposed suggests to substitute theambiguous relation names with well-defined relation names to conceptsconsistently while mapping a domain. We suggest the use of this methodfor introducing rigor in concept mapping and position it among the othermodels of knowledge representation in an inverse semantic spectrum.</p>

## Feasibility of Refined Concept Maps

Meena Kharatmal and Nagarjuna G., "Refined Concept Maps  for Science Education: A FeasibilityStudy", 2009. [Download PDF file](assets/Refined-Concept-Maps-for-Science-Education-A-Feasibility-2009.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> Refined  concept  map  (RCM)  is  comprised  of  node  names and a well-defined, invariant, minimal set of relation names. Using  RCM  as  a  methodology,  it  can  be  applied  to  study the changes in the knowledge structure, as a tool for analysis of forms of representations. In this paper, we discuss the study conducted to test the ease and feasibility of RCM by comparing it with other modes of representation. A homo-geneous sample of school students were assigned the same task from a specific domain. The analysis shows that it was easy and feasible to use RCM by the school students. The fixed set of relation names, does not affect the expression of  knowledge  and  at  the  same  time  helps  in  representing accurate knowledge. The constraints in the RCM served as an anchoring and a facilitator  for  representing  scientific knowledge.</p>

## Representing Change

Meena Kharatmal & Nagarjuna G., "Representing Change Using Concept Maps", 2013. [Download PDF file](assets/Representing-Change-Using-Concept-Maps-2013.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">While concept maps have been quite extensively used to represent static descriptions, it has not been used for its full potential for representing changes or processes. We propose a template and a limited set of linking phrases for representing change, with partial amendments in the concept mapping technique and the CmapTools. Usually, a process is represented in a object-centric manner specifying the object’s role in it. In this proposal, we suggest a process-centric strategy with certain heuristics for representing processes. Considering the view that a process is a name to a change of state of an object involving time, sequence, causes, we make necessary proposals to the vocabulary and the form of representing a process. We end with a discussion on implications of this proposal to science education and concept mapping in general.</p>

Shaikh, R., Padalkar, S., Sutar, P. and Kumar, A., "Learning Basic Astronomy Through an Embodied and Interactive Approach", 2020. [Download PDF file](assets/Shaikhetal-epiSTEME8.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Students and adults struggle to understand the explanations of simple astronomical phenomena. Research has shown that much of the difficulty lies with students’ difficulty to use visuospatial reasoning. Drawing on research on embodied cognition, multimodality and multimedia learning, a short pedagogic sequence called ‘Basic Astronomy module’ was designed around multiple external representations such as concrete models, gestures, roleplays, animations, interactive digital games and diagrams. In the present study, we closely monitored the implementation of the module by seven teachers in government schools in Jaipur district of Rajasthan, India to study the teaching-learning process through the module and its effectiveness. In this paper,we will document the learning outcomes of the module in terms of conceptual understanding, attitudes and beliefs. Results show that students ’understanding of basic astronomy concepts improved significantly after completion of the module; Additionally, students’ beliefs and attitudes towards science and specifically towards astronomy changed.</p>

## Knowledge Organizers for Science Education

Meena Kharatmal and Nagarjuna G., "Understanding Science Through Knowledge Organizers: An Introduction", 2004. [Download PDF file](assets/Understanding-Science-Through-Knowledge-Organizers-An-Introduction-2004.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We propose, in this paper,  a teaching program based on a grammar of scientific language borrowed mostly from the area of knowledge representation in computer science and logic. The paper introduces an operationizable framework for understanding knowledge using knowledge representation(KR) methodology. We start with organizing concepts based on their cognitive function, followed by assigning valid and authentic semantic relations to the concepts. We propose that in science education, students can understand better if they organize their knowledge using the KR principles. The process, we claim, can help them to align their conceptual framework with that of experts 'conceptual framework which we assume is the goal of science education.</p>

## Understanding Students' Questioning

Gurinder Singh, Rafikh Shaikh and Karen Haydock , "Understanding student questioning" [Download PDF file](assets/UnderstandingStudentQuestioning.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> Our investigation focusses on a group of eleven lower-middle-class students from classrooms in which the teachers did most of the talking and students rarely asked any questions. We have examined whether spontaneous discussions among the students in a less structured setting would include questioning, and what kinds of questions they might ask. Our study is based within a historical dialectical materialist framework. We particularly wanted to find out whether, given a material context - an unusual variegated tree - the students would spontaneously ask questions about the tree, or whether they would need some sort of teacher’s guidance in order to do so. We were motivated to raise these research questions partly by worries that a culture of an unquestioning student passivity may exist and that such a culture may be an expedient way of maintaining social norms. Rather than testing out a teaching strategy, our broader aim was to understand the students and find out whether or in what sense they might practice science. We explored the role of the teachers and the context in the students’ questioning process by analysing student talk and interactions with each other and with the tree. We found that, in the course of their spontaneous discussions, even with very little teacher guidance, the students engaged in questioning and asked each other a surprising number of investigatable science questions. Their questioning was mainly authentic, and was both explicit and implicit. We claim that their questioning was a dialectical process in which conflicts arose due to interactions between students, as well as between students and the tree. Even though the students had never done practical science activities in their classrooms, they spontaneously performed some experiments to find answers to their own questions. We present evidence that they did this despite thinking that they were not supposed to do so. We discuss how and why the students engaged in questioning and investigating. We also discuss possibilities for how student questioning could flourish, even if not officially encouraged, at least as a subversive activity. </p>

**Keywords**: student questioning, historical dialectical materialism, open-beginninged, explicit and implicit questioning, investigatable questions.

## Reference Set of Linking Words

Meena Kharatmal and G. Nagarjuna, "Using Semantic Reference Set of Linking Words for Concept Mapping in Biology", 2016. [Download PDF file](assets/Using-Semantic-Reference-Set-of-Linking-Words-for-Concept-Mapping-in-Biology-2016.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> Inspired by the semantic network studies we propose additional conventions for choosing linking words and arrive at a Reference Set of semantically well-defined linking words drawn from the Knowledge Representation area of research in the domain of biology. Each linking word in the set is assigned a dimension: part-whole, class-inclusion, spatial-inclusion, function and attribution. We study expert representations by content analysis of biology texts at three levels of increasing subject complexity. We compare the linking words used in these representations with the Reference Set and find an increasing degree of proximity to the latter. This indicates that experts tend touse more well-defined linking words. Regarding this proximity as a characteristic of expertise, we can encourage novices to re-represent their concept maps using the linking words from the Reference Set. We discuss the implications of the approach for science education.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Concept  maps  are  found  to  be  useful  in  eliciting  knowledge,  meaningful  learning,  evaluation  of  understanding  and  in  studying the nature of changes taking place during cognitive development, particularly in the classroom. Several experts have claimed the  effectiveness  of  this  tool  for  learning  science.  We  agree  with  the  claim,  but  the  effectiveness  will  improve  only  if  we  gradually introduce a certain amount of discipline in constructing the maps. The discipline is warranted, we argue, because science thrives to be an  unambiguous  and  rigorously  structured  body  of  knowledge.  Since  learning  science  may  be  seen  as  a  process  where  a  novice  is  expected to be transformed into an expert, we use the context of learning science for making the proposal. Further, we identify certain anomalies  in  the  evaluation  of  concept  maps,  and  suggest  that  the  evaluation  should  be  based  on  semantics  of  the  linking  words  (relation types) and not on graphical criteria alone. </p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> In  this   paper,  we  propose an  objective  assessment  technique  for  evaluating  students'  knowledge structure.  The assessment task  is to  create propositions  based on  providing  with  constraints  i.e. concepts and linking words (relation types).  The propositions are validated based on a comparison with an expert's knowledge base. An illustration of the technique is presented from the domain of senior secondary school level biology.</p>

Conference on Concept Mapping*, 2008 [Download PDF file](assets/12-cmc2008-p260.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> During the course of science education one of the recognizable and desirable changes from a novice to an expert is in their  language  (knowledge  representation).  One  noticeable  change  is  that  of  weeding  out  ambiguous  expressions  bringing  in  clarity and rigor. However, this happens not by weeding out the concept names but by choosing more and more accurate linking words (relation names). By focusing on the relation names we report the results of a preliminary study that confirms that subject experts  increasingly  chose  relation  names  (linking  words)  that  come  closer  to  formal  descriptions.  The  significance  of  this  observation  to  concept  mapping  community  as  well  as  to  cognitive  development  is  immense,  for  it  provides  a  simple  and  effective  method  to  study  conceptual  change,  validates  the  use  of  refined  concept  maps  in  place  of  the  traditional  technique  inscience education, and also further strengthens the approach that relationship between nodes determine the semantics, and not the nodes per se.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Keeping the requirements of the semantic web in mind we have developed a pure text based collaborative editing environment to create, update and manage knowledge networks and structured documents. It works as a client to the GNOWSYS server. GNOWSYS (Gnowledge Networking and Organizing System) is a frame based triple-store supporting version control, publishing and managing multiple ontologies along with instances.</p>

## Concept Maps for Science Education

Meena Kharatmal and Nagarjuna G., "Refined Concept Maps  for Science Education: A Feasibility Study". [Download PDF file](assets/16-meena-gn.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Refined  concept  map  (RCM)  is  comprised  of  node  names and a well-defined, invariant, minimal set of relation names. Using  RCM  as  a  methodology,  it  can  be  applied  to  study the changes in the knowledge structure, as a tool for analysis of forms of representations. In this paper, we discuss the study conducted to test the ease and feasibility of RCM by comparing it with other modes of representation. A homo-geneous sample of school students were assigned the same task from a specific domain. The analysis shows that it was easy and feasible to use RCM by the school students. The fixed set of relation names, does not affect the expression of  knowledge  and  at  the  same  time  helps  in  representing accurate knowledge. The constraints in the RCM served as an  anchoring  and  a  facilitator  for  representing  scientific knowledge</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We  propose  in  this  paper  a  simple  method  to  construct  a machine  processable  semantic  network,  called  a  dependency  network, that gathers all the concepts and skills as nodes and the relation type “depends on”, (and its inverse “required for”), as their edges. As a conceptual  structure  can  be  used  to  compute  a  roadmap  of  any  learning-teaching objective. As a prelude we build and contribute a seed graph for demonstration and introduce a collaborative portal for contributing, publishing  and  dynamically  building  dependency  networks.  A  possible generalization  of  this  methodology  for  knowledge  organization  is  discussed.</p>

## ANALYSIS OF GRAPHS IN SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS

Amit Dhakulkar and Nagarjuna G, "An analysis of graphs in school textbooks" [Download PDF file](assets/19-dhakulkar-nagarjunag.pdf)
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We present here an analysis of school textbooks with graphs and  related  activities  as  the  point  of  focus.  The  sample textbooks that we have considered for the analysis are NCERT textbooks  (from  Grade  5  to  Grade  10,  in  the  subjects  of Science,  Mathematics  and  Social  Sciences).  A  quantitative analysis  is  done  on  frequency  of  occurrence,  types  and features of the graphs present in the different textbooks. We observe that the graphs are under-represented in the school textbooks. Considering the importance of the ability to read, construct  and  interpret  graphs  in  science  and  mathematics education we recommend strongly that in the future edition of textbooks graphs should be properly represented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Epicycles  were  historically  used  by  the  ancient  Greeks  to explain  the  retrograde  motion  of  planets.  This  episode  in history of science is used as a case to show how we can use computer  simulations  to  visualize  complex,  abstract  ideas and  difficult  to  imagine  constructions.  We  present  here  a method developed using the dynamic mathematics software GeoGebra, to teach the concept of epicycles.</p>

## ANALYSIS OF GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE

Meena Kharatmal and Nagarjuna G., "An analysis of Growth of knowledge based on concepts and predicates - A Preliminary study" [Download PDF file](assets/21-analysis-growth-knowledge-concepts-predicates-epi4-paper.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Using the methodology of Refined Concept Mapping, we rerepresent the domain of cell biology of secondary and higher secondary levels of textbooks. In this study, we demonstrate that  although  the  number  of  concept  terms  increase progressively,  the  predicate  terms  achieve  constancy depicting  a  finite  set.  This  indicates  that  for  acquiring expertise  in  a  domain,  a  finite  set  of  predicate  terms  is sufficient.  In  this  paper,  we  illustrate  the  methodology  and discuss the pedagogical implications of the study</p>

**Keywords**: Refined  concept  map,  Predicates,  Attributes,Knowledge  representation,  Cell  biology.

## Complex networks in a free-software operating system
Rajiv Nair, G Nagarjuna, Arnab K Ray, "Features of complex networks in a free-software operating system" *International Conference on Recent Trends in Physic*, 2012. [Download PDF file](assets/23-1742-6596_365_1_012058.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We  propose  a  mathematical  model  to  fit  the  degree  distribution  of  directed  dependency networks  in  free  and  open-source  software.   In  this  complex  system,  the  intermediate  scales  of  both the in-directed and out-directed dependency networks follow a power-law trend (specifically Zipf’s law). Deviations from this feature are found both for the highly linked nodes, and the poorly linked nodes.  This is due to finite-size effects in the networks, and the parameters needed to model finite-size behaviour make a quantitative distinction between the in-directed and out-directed networks.  We also provide a model to describe the dynamic evolution of the network, and account for its saturation in the long-time limit.</p>

## Measuring the Mustard Seed
Amit Dhakulkar, Samir Dhurde & Nagarjuna G., "Measuring the Mustard Seed: First Exercise in Modelling the Real World". [Download PDF file](assets/24-136-389-1-PB.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Constructing, reading and understanding graphs is an inter disciplinary and important skill in today’s world. Though being such an important skill students are not taught explicitly to develop this important skill. Also there has been an urge in the literature for the students to use real world data to make sense ofthe concepts that they learn. In general students are not provided with opportunities to make the skill explicit, and link it up with their life experiences the concepts and subjects that they learn. We present here a simple task which provides the students a context in which real world data is collected, and used to construct a simple linear mathematical model. This task connects different skills like measurement, graphicacy, mathematical modelling and at the same time also helps a two way transition between the abstract mathematical world and the concrete physical world.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">This work is an effort to convert undergraduate college laboratories into contemporary, open-ended interactive, inquiry-driven and collaborative research laboratories and hence bridge the gap between practice and theory of biology. The programme Collaborative Undergraduate Biology Education (CUBE), as the name suggests, is an invitation to young researchers at the undergraduate level into the nature of scientific inquiry through its essential component of collaboration. Our aim is to design 'functional learning ecologies' by means of simple model systems to facilitate collaborative undergraduate research in the frontiers of biology.</p>
